# Warmup: Create an HTML Document From Scratch

The goal of this exercise is to write an HTML document from scratch, from _memory_. It should have all the required tags and attributes, as well as:

* 2 levels of headings
* Some regular text
* Bullet points
* A numbered list
* A linked stylesheet (styles.css) with at least two rules 

When you're done, send a pull request to this repository with your work.
